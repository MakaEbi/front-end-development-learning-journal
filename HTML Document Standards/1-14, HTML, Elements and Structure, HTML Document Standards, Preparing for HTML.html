<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 1: Declare the HTML Document Type
At the very top of your file, before any other code, add the document type declaration.
This declaration must tell the browser that the document uses HTML5.
It should not be inside any HTML element or tag.
====================================== -->

<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 2: Add Root Structure
Below the document type declaration, add the root element that will contain all HTML content.
Inside this root, include two main child elements:
- One for metadata and title
- One for visible content
Do not add any actual content yet.
====================================== -->

<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 3: Explain the Doctype with a Comment
At the top of your HTML file, add a comment that says exactly:
 This document starts with a doctype declaration
The comment must be placed above the root element, but not inside any tag.
====================================== -->

<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 4: Create a Visible Title
Inside the metadata section, add a title element.
The title must say exactly: My HTML Practice Page
This text should appear in the browser tab when the file is opened.
Do not add visible headings or paragraphs yet.
====================================== -->
<!--This document starts with a doctype declaration-->

<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 5: Save the File Correctly
Make sure your file is saved using the correct extension for HTML.
The extension must be exactly: .html
Do not include spaces or special characters in the file name.
====================================== -->

<!-- ======================================
🔸 EXERCISE 6: Preserve Future Compatibility
Verify that your document type declaration is placed as the first line.
It should not be indented, commented out, or nested inside any other element.
This ensures correct interpretation even when HTML standards change in the future.
====================================== -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My HTML Practice Page</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
